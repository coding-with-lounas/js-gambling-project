This project is a JavaScript-based gambling game that I developed while following along with a tutorial by Tech With Tim on YouTube. Through this project, I have learned and practiced many fundamental concepts in JavaScript and Node.js.
Features

Command Line Interface: A simple and intuitive CLI that allows users to interact with the game.
Game Logic: Core gambling mechanics implemented using JavaScript.
Randomness: Utilizes JavaScript's Math.random() function to ensure fair gameplay.
 ***
# What I Learned :

JavaScript Basics: Variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.
Node.js Basics: Setting up a Node.js project, using require and module.exports.
CLI Interaction: Handling user input and output in the terminal.
Debugging: Identifying and fixing errors in the code.
Project Structure: Organizing code into manageable files and functions.
